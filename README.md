- Week 1 Intro

- Week 2 Nearest Neighbor Search: Retrieving Documents
  - Implement nearest neighbor search for retrieval tasks
  - Contrast document representations (e.g., raw word counts, tf-idf,â€¦)
    - Emphasize important words using tf-idf
  - Contrast methods for measuring similarity between two documents
    - Euclidean vs. weighted Euclidean
    - Cosine similarity vs. similarity via unnormalized inner product
  - Describe complexity of brute force search
  - Implement KD-trees for nearest neighbor search
  - Implement LSH for approximate nearest neighbor search
  - Compare pros and cons of KD-trees and LSH, and decide which is more appropriate for given dataset
